filename: encrypt_decrypt.txt
========================================
Program Description
This program allows the user to encrypt the contents of a textfile based on an
easily remembered phrase with which the user is familiar, and which that user
is unlikely to forget. The program can also decrypt such a file, but the phrase
used to encrypt the file must be supplied at the time of decrypting as well.

The program takes its input from the command line, and there must be exactly
these four input values, in the order shown:
1. Either the single letter e (for encoding) or d (for decoding)
2. The name of the input file (which will contain plain text if encoding,
   or encoded text if decoding)
2. The name of the output file (which will contain encoded text if encoding,
   or plain text if decoding)
3. The phrase to be used for encoding or decoding (must contain at least 10
   printable characters)

The program must pause and report each of the following errors, if it occurs,
and then terminate:
1. Incorrect number of parameters.
2. Bad first parameter.
3. Cannot open file.ext for input.
4. Cannot open file.ext for output.

                                                                 Screen 1 of 1
